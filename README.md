# Python Projects Repository

Welcome to my repository where I store all my Python projects, including both old and new ones. This is a collection of various Python scripts that cover a variety of topics and fields.

## Projects

1. **Password Auto Generator**
   This Python script generates a randomized secure password using a combination of letters (uppercase & lowercase), numbers, and symbols. The length of each character type is chosen randomly between 2 and 4 to ensure variety and security.
How It Works:

1Ô∏è‚É£ The script randomly selects a few letters, symbols, and numbers.
2Ô∏è‚É£ These characters are added to a list and then shuffled for randomness.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Finally, the characters are joined together to form a strong password, which is displayed to the user.
Technologies Used:

    Python üêç
    Random Module (for generating random characters & shuffling)

How to Run the Script:

Simply execute the Python script in any Python environment:

python password_auto_generator.py

2. **PyPassword Generator**
   - This Python script is a password generator that allows the user to customize the number of letters, symbols, and numbers in their password. The generated password is then randomly shuffled to increase security.
How It Works:

1Ô∏è‚É£ The user inputs how many letters, symbols, and numbers they want in the password.
2Ô∏è‚É£ The script selects random characters from predefined lists of letters, symbols, and numbers.
3Ô∏è‚É£ The selected characters are then shuffled to make the password stronger.
4Ô∏è‚É£ The final password is displayed to the user.

Technologies Used:

    Python üêç
    Random Module (for selecting and shuffling characters)

How to Run the Script:

Simply execute the Python script in any Python environment:

python password_generator.py
